Riot Match Parsing
By Beau LaManna, for CompeteLeague North America

The goal of the software is to compile matches of League of Legends through the use of the Riot API, in order to gain insights and statistics regarding the various characters (read; "Champions") within League of Legends.

The Champion Dictionary directory contains the text output of the Champion Dictionary system. This system is designed to map the IDs of each champion in League of Legends to their name.

Libraries contains all used libraries by the Riot Match Parsing system. Currently, the only used library is the Orianna Riot API wrapper written by meraki-analytics on Github; https://github.com/meraki-analytics/Orianna.

src contains all source code used by the system. My Riot API key is omitted for security reasons.

Stats contains the output of the Match Parsing system, separated by region and then year.
